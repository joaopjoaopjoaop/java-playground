# Java Learning Project
This is a project I created to learn Java. It includes small files that demonstrate different aspects of the language, including control structures, data types, and object-oriented programming for personal use.

## Ideas for Programs
* Hello World: A simple program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. 
* Calculator: A program that prompts the user for two numbers and performs a mathematical operation on them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). 
* Guessing Game: A game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. 
* Bank Account: A program that simulates a bank account and allows the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. 
* Shapes: A program that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism by creating different types of shapes and calculating their areas.

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE. 
3. Run the individual programs by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Run" or by clicking the
4. "Run" button in the IDE.
