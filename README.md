# Java Learning Project
This is a project I created to learn Java. It includes small files that demonstrate different aspects of the language, including control structures, data types, and object-oriented programming for personal use.

## Ideas for Programs
* Hello World: A simple program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. 
* Calculator: A program that prompts the user for two numbers and performs a mathematical operation on them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). 
* Guessing Game: A game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. 
* Bank Account: A program that simulates a bank account and allows the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. 
* Shapes: A program that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism by creating different types of shapes and calculating their areas.
